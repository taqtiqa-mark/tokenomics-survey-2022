Finally, $A_{t}$ evolves according to the geometric Brownian motion stochastic differential equation,

        \begin{equation}

        \frac{d A_{t}}{A_{t}} = \widehat{\mu}^{A}\!d t+{\sigma}^{A}\!d\widehat{Z}_{t}^{A}

        \end{equation}

        where $\widehat{Z}_{t}^{A}$ is a standard Brownian motion under the physical measure and $\widehat{\mu}^{A}$ and ${\sigma}^{A}$ are constant parameters.
