  abstract     = {The rise of cryptocurrency as a new sui generis asset class creates a need for a new classification scheme to cover the wide range of functionality for which tokens can be used. By differentiating tokens based on their functional attributes, cryptocurrency tokens can be categorized into crypto-transaction tokens (which act as a cash substitute); crypto-fuel tokens (which underpin generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens (which can be exchanged for a predefined asset). This classification is applied to identify important issues when considering whether to participate in a cryptocurrency system, such as the impact of potential forks, token supply expectations, and the level of dependence on a few operators (entity dependence). For crypto-transaction tokens (and crypto-fuel tokens if used in a similar or overlapping role) it shows the importance of the token being seen as a “better” form of money. For crypto-fuel tokens, the popularity of blockchain applications and the utility of the crypto-fuel system in application development is vital. For crypto-voucher tokens, the value of the underlying asset, the token’s exchangeability for that asset, and the importance of a digital representation should be considered by participants. The interplay between fundamentals and speculation as drivers of price are considered.}

However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework—Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)—was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain.}

New chapters cover asset pricing empirics with possible resolutions to puzzles; analysis of credible government policy that entails state variables other than reputation; and foundations of aggregate labor supply with time averaging replacing employment lotteries. Other new material includes a multi-country analysis of taxation in a growth model, elaborations of the fiscal theory of the price level, and age externalities in a matching model. The book is suitable for both first- and second-year graduate courses in macroeconomics and monetary economics. Most chapters conclude with exercises.

\begin{abstract}
\begin{quote}
This project highlights some tools and techniques relevant to the design of a token economy under a rational expectations hypothesis.  Six articles are reviewed, these enumerate the conditions for equilibrium pricing of effervescent-coins, dampened-coins, breakable-coins and redeemable-coins. A review of Polkadot parallel-chain coin designs indicate there are differences in the issues and risks addressed by token equilibrium pricing models and those addressed by the designs practiced in the Polkadot ecosystem.
\end{quote}
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents

\section{Background}
This project emerged from an effort to take a token-economy design and bootstrap some settings for a launch state. That is also the scope of the ideas and topics raised here.  The context is a competitive rational expectations equilibrium setting.  The definition of "rational expectations" in economics is due to John Muth\autocite{muth61}:

\begin{quote}
    \textit{In order to explain fairly simply how expectations are formed, we advance the hypothesis that they are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory.}
\end{quote}

Calculating a equilibrium in these settings is generally done via fixed point theorems.  For examples: Robert Lucas\autocite{lucas72} defines a rational expectations equilibrium as a fixed point in a space of functions of Markov state vectors, while Thomas Sargent\autocite{sargent71} defines it as a fixed point in a space of stochastic processes. Since then, a multitude of introductory text book treatments have emerged. Darrell Duffie's text\autocite{duffie01} is considered a sound introduction, with an orientation exercise in Chapter 1 illustrating the use of a fixed point theorem to establish whether an equilibrium exists. Similarly, the text\autocite{ljungqvist18} by Ljungqvist and Sargent provides a sound background.

\section{Token-Economy}

None of the reviewed Polkadot parachain token/coins were designed with an explicit equilibrium objective, nor using an rational expectations framework (with the possible exception of the Equilibrium parachain, see Table \ref{table:ntet} ). No Polkadot parachain identifies an expression for \textit{stylized} token price dynamics.
Hence, it was not possible to identify, across multiple parachains, those elements of rational expectations modeling used in the design of Polkadot parachain tokens. Consequently, in place of such a summary, a series of flow-charts/decision-trees is presented that may help developers identify the scope of their token design. 

It is important to remember that what follows represents the author's subjective choices of elements or characteristics to model. The subsequent appearance of some of those same elements or characteristics in the articles selected for the annotated bibliography should not be interpreted as evidence that those elements or characteristics are indispensable or ideal. It is worth noting that the development of token designs is still in its early stages, and significant technical advancements often require substantial time.

Choices/tradeoffs that a token designer may wish to consider have been grouped under the following topics:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[] Model: structural vs reduced form
    \item[] Economy: open vs ajar vs closed
    \item[] Equilibrium: partial vs general
    \item[] Sectors: public vs private, financial vs real and their interactions
    \item[] Production: Cobb-Douglas vs constant elasticity of substitution
    \item[] Monetary: Neutral vs Non-neutral Money, Quantity Theory of Money vs Fiscal Theory of the Price Level etc.
\end{enumerate}

Other attributes/specifications of a native token economy that are generally absent for Polkadot parachains are: Agent Utility, Market Rates (Riskless Rates + Risk Premia), Rate Curves (by maturity), Borrowing/Lending, Lender of Last Resort.

\subsection{Economy Type}
A token economy can be classified as open if it allows unrestricted staking and rewarding using the native coin (NC) of other token economies, as well as accepting the native coins of other token economies as a means of payment for transaction fees. On the other hand, if a token economy does not meet these criteria partially or fully, it can be categorized as either ajar or closed. The same classification can also be applied when using tokens instead of native coins. In this context, staking refers to the actions taken to ensure the security of the blockchain.

\subsection{Model Type}
Reduced-form models establish relationships between endogenous variables based on observable exogenous variables. Structural models, on the other hand, originate from theories and provide a deeper understanding of behavioral patterns, which may involve unobservable parameters. The selection of an approach is frequently influenced by data availability and considerations related to estimation and calibration. In the absence of data, simulations are often employed as an alternative method.

\subsection{Equilibrium Type}
General equilibrium theory aims to provide an explanation of the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in an entire economy comprising multiple interacting markets. Its objective is to demonstrate that the interaction between demand and supply leads to an overall state of general equilibrium. This contrasts the theory of partial equilibrium, which focuses on analyzing a specific part of the economy while assuming other factors remain constant.

In a general equilibrium model, the overall equilibrium quantities and prices are determined endogenously for the entire economy. This involves considering initial endowments and modeling agent behavior, with the objective of describing changes in prices and quantities that result in a "Pareto Optimal" outcome. On the other hand, a partial equilibrium model focuses on analyzing a specific part of the economy while assuming other parts to be constant or even absent. In such cases, either the price or quantity process is typically specified, and the other variable is derived from it, which necessitates a reduced-form model. It is worth noting that a partial equilibrium approach can sometimes lead to outcomes where no trade occurs. When possible, it can be beneficial to calculate an equivalent structural equilibrium that supports a reduced-form partial equilibrium specification, and vice versa.

\subsection{Sector Type}
Multisector models are used to explore the allocation of resources across different activities, e.g. validator staking vs non-validator bonding. Commonly studied are consumption vs investment, public vs private, real vs financial sectors. It is becoming more common to model more than two sectors, the number and character of each sector is either self evident, or too unique to be summarized in a decision tree.

\subsection{Production Type}
A production function is a specification of how the quantity of output behaves as a function of the inputs used in production.  In both general and partial equilibrium settings it is used to connect different parts of an economy, for example the Production-CAPM\autocite{cochrane91}.  Only two production functions are considered here: The Cobb-Douglas (C-D) and the Constant Elasticity of Substitution\footnote{Leontief, linear and Cobb–Douglas functions are special cases of the CES production function.} (CES).  Elasticity of substitution (ES) is a measure of how easy it is to shift between factor inputs - the percentage change in the ratio of the two inputs relative to the percentage change in their prices.

\subsection{Monetary Type}
Monetary Policy is one of the most fraught topics in macroeconomics. There is no consensus on an unconditionally optimal policy. An important choice will be between adopting non-neutral or neutral monetary policies. While there is no consensus on the optimal choice, there are extensive literature on both. The monetary policy related lectures for The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel\autocite{nobel}, provide a useful review of the background, progress and contorversies. Generally the designer of a token-economy will be left to chose from among the alternatives below.

\subsection{Native Token Functions}

This analysis is limited to publicly available network whitepapers or token-economy/tokenomics documentation. None of the reviewed Polkadot parachain tokens/coins were designed using a rational expectations framework (with the possible exception of the Equilibrium parachain), and none derive an expression for their token price dynamics. Consequently, the range of functionality for which tokens can be used have been summarized using the classification scheme put forward by Burnie, Burnie, and Henderson(2018)\autocite{burnie18}.  In their scheme, differentiating tokens based on functional attributes, tokens are categorised into crypto-transaction tokens (cash substitutes); crypto-fuel tokens (generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens (exchangeable for a cosumption good). This classification helps identify issues to consider when participating in a cryptocurrency system.  For crypto-transaction and crypto-fuel tokens is the token a better form of money? For crypto-fuel tokens, the application user base and the utility of the token system are more important. For crypto-voucher tokens, the value of the numeraire good and the token’s exchangeability are important considerations.

\section{Token Price Models}

While the articles included here may be the first generation of Token pricing models, they nontheless encompass a reasonably broad range of Token characteristics and price dynamics. These are categorized as:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Effervescent-coins:} \fullcite{cong21}
    \item \textbf{Dampened-coins:} \fullcite{cong22}
    \item \textbf{Breakable-coins:} \fullcite{sockin23a} and \fullcite{sockin23b}
    \item \textbf{Redeemable-coins:} \fullcite{rogoff22}

\section{Methodology}
The published research annotated are the top-6 articles selected from the commercial research databases available from the State Library of New South Wales. This list was arrived at in the following stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preparation:
    by operationalizing the inquiry \textit{"Refereed articles on block-chain token-economics using rational expectations equilibrium (a.k.a. no-arbitrage) arguments/analysis, ranked by journal impact factors"};
    \item Retrieval:
    eliminating duplicates;
    \item Screening:
    removing false positives;
    ranking by journal impact factor;
    \item Selection:
    selecting the top-6; and
    \item Write-up:
    reviewing remaining article abstracts and substituting where judged appropriate.
\end{enumerate}


The annotated bibliography component of this project is closest to a "Scoping Review"\autocite{grant09}, and Table~\ref{tbl:flowchart}.

Each section of the report/working paper was developed using some subset of the following iterative process\autocite{tsafnat14}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Review reporting guidelines, best practice handbooks, and training modules [preparation stage]
    \item Formulate question and decide on review type [preparation stage]
    \item Search for previous published literature [preparation stage]
    \item Develop and test search strategies [preparation stage]
    \item Review search strategies [preparation stage]
    \item Execute search [retrieval stage]
    \item De-duplicate data/information [retrieval stage]
    \item Screen title and abstracts [screening stage]
    \item Retrieve full-text articles [retrieval stage]
    \item Screen articles in full-text [screening stage]
    \item Search for grey literature (preprints, working papers) [retrieval stage]
    \item Quality assessment and data/information extraction [synthesis stage]
    \item Citation chasing [retrieval stage]
    \item Update database searches [retrieval stage]
    \item Synthesize data/information [synthesis stage]
