  abstract     = {The rise of cryptocurrency as a new sui generis asset class creates a need for a new classification scheme to cover the wide range of functionality for which tokens can be used. By differentiating tokens based on their functional attributes, cryptocurrency tokens can be categorised into crypto-transaction tokens (which act as a cash substitute); crypto-fuel tokens (which underpin generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens (which can be exchanged for a predefined asset). This classification is applied to identify important issues when considering whether to participate in a cryptocurrency system, such as the impact of potential forks, token supply expectations and the level of dependence on a few operators (entity-dependence). For crypto-transaction tokens (and crypto-fuel tokens if used in a similar or overlapping role) it shows the importance of the token being seen as a “better” form of money. For crypto-fuel tokens, the popularity of blockchain applications and the utility of the crypto-fuel system in application development is vital. For crypto-voucher tokens, the value of the underlying asset, the token’s exchangeability for that asset and the importance of a digital representation should be considered by participants. The interplay between fundamentals and speculation as drivers of price is considered.}

However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods:  Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework—Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)—was used to examine the main review types. Results:  Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions:  Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain.}

\section{Background}
This project emerged from an effort to take a token-economy design and bootstrap some settings for a launch state. That is also the scope of the ideas and topics raised here - a bootstrapping exercise.  The context is a competitive equilibrium setting rather than any non-competitive Nash-only type of equilibrium.
The definition of "Rational Expectations" is due to John Muth\autocite{muth61}:
\begin{quote}
In order to explain fairly simply how expectations are formed, we advance the hypothesis that they are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory.
\end{quote}
Calculating a competitive equilibrium in these settings is generally done via fixed point theorems.  For examples: Robert Lucas\autocite{lucas72} defines a rational expectations equilibrium as a fixed point in a space of functions of Markov state vectors, while Thomas Sargent\autocite{sargent71} defines it as a fixed point in a space of stochastic processes. Since then, a multitude of introductory text book treatments have emerged. Darrell Duffie's text\autocite{duffie01} is considered a sound introduction, with an orientation exercise in Chapter 1 illustrating the use of a fixed point theorem to establish whether an equilibrium exists.

\section{Token-Economy Taxonomy}

This analysis of the Parachain tokenomics is limited to publicly available whitepapers or token-economy/tokenomics documentation. Initial proposal flow-chart/decision-tree development that will help developers place their token in the following contexts.
Types under the following topics

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[] Model: structural vs reduced form
    \item[] Economy: open vs ajar vs closed
    \item[] Equilibrium: partial vs general
    \item[] Sectors: public vs private, financial vs real and their interactions
    \item[] Production: Cobb-Douglas vs constant elasticity of substitution
    \item[] Monetary: Quantity Theory of Money vs Fiscal Theory of the Price Level etc.
\end{enumerate}

Other attributes/specifications of a native token economy that are generally absent are: Agent Utility, Market Rates (Riskless Rates + Risk Premia), Rate Curves (by maturity), Borrowing/Lending, Lender of Last Resort.

The Equilibrium Parachain is a notable exception:

        \tnote[b]{The state price process isn't explicitly specified (some references suggest a Black-Scholes-Merton type, others a jump-diffusion), hence it is not possible to identify a single supporting partial equilibrium with confidence.  Nonetheless, I describe the effort as a partial equilibrium.}

}

It is fair to say that most Parachain have not found it necessary to specify their token-economy by including or analyzing the effects of the above considerations. 
It is difficult to sustain the argument that this has adversely affected the ability to raise capital. For those funded via Initial Coin Offerings, one can argue this access to capital absent even cursory evidence the 'economy' is sustainable, simply reflects the exploitative nature of ICOs. However, that argument is less plausible where capital has been raised more scrupulously (i.e. compliance with the minimal investor safeguards regulators require) and with more difficulty, from sophisticated Venture Capital funds.

A plausible conjecture is that all participants regard any deterioration of their economy as improbable or:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item slow to emerge,
    \item have self evident causes and
    \item those causes will be reversible.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Economy Type}
A token-economy is open if it engages in unrestricted staking and rewarding with the native coins (NC) of other token-economies, and if it accepts the NC of other token-economies as medium of payment for its transaction fees. Otherwise the token-economy is ajar or closed.  Similar classification can be done using tokens in place of NC. Here staking refers to efforts to secure the blockchain.

\subsection{Model Type}
Reduced-form models express relations between endogenous variables in terms of observable exogenous variables. Structural models derive from a theory, describe behavior at a deeper level and may include un-observable parameters. Often the choice of approach is driven by data and estimation/calibration considerations.  Absent data, simulations are often used.

general equilibrium theory attempts to explain the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that the interaction of demand and supply will result in an overall general equilibrium. General equilibrium theory contrasts to the theory of partial equilibrium, which analyzes a specific part of an economy while its other factors are held constant.

\subsection{Equilibrium Type}
In a general equilibrium model, the over-all equilibrium quantities and prices are calculated endogenously, usually starting with initial endowments and a model of agent behavior - the objective is to describe changes in prices and quantities such that the result is "Pareto Optimal". A partial equilibrium model analyzes a specific part of an economy (assuming others parts constant or even absent), frequently either the price or quantity process is specified and the other derived from it, hence necessitates a reduced-form model.  Often a partial equilibrium approach results in "no-trade" outcomes.  When possible, it can be useful to calculate a structural equivalent equilibrium that "supports" a reduced-form partial equilibrium specification, and vice versa.  
% It is also useful to bear the following distinction in mind:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item[] Competitive equilibrium: price vector (or price \& quantity vectors) at which supply equals demand
%     \item[] Nash equilibrium (out of scope): each agent choice is optimal given the other agents choices.
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sector Type}
Multisector models are used to explore the allocation of resources across different activities, e.g. validator staking vs non-validator bonding. Commonly studied are consumption vs investment, public vs private, real vs financial sectors. It is becoming more common to model more than two sectors, the number and character of each sector is either self evident, or too unique to be summarized in a decision tree.

\subsection{Production Type}
A production function is a specification of how the quantity of output behaves as a function of the inputs used in production.  In both general and partial equilibrium settings it is used to connect different parts of an economy, for example the Production-CAPM\footnote{\cite{cochrane91}}.  Only two production functions are considered here: The Cobb-Douglas (C-D) and the Constant Elasticity of Substitution\footnote{Leontief, linear and Cobb–Douglas functions are special cases of the CES production function.} (CES).  Elasticity of substitution (ES) is a measure of how easy it is to shift between factor inputs - the percentage change in the ratio of the two inputs relative to the percentage change in their prices.

% C-D has constant factor shares regardless of effective factor levels, CES does not. C-D has elasticity of substitution equal to one.
%  CES production function, allows n inputs to produce some quantity of output - for more than 2 factors there is not constant elasticity of substitution among all factors.
%  CES allows for non-negative and constant elasticity of substitution

\section{Scope}
The prevalence of crypto-currencies means the decision to exclude them warrants some explanation. Microeconomic (partial) equilibria are generally explicitly constructed (which proves existence) using conjectured properties of the dividends (or an equivalent) from the economic activity. Specifically, a price is the present-value (i.e. discounted for time and non-diversifiable risk), of all future dividends. Since the dividends of fiat currencies are zero this approach does not work. While there are workarounds, they, being particular, are not of interest in the more general settings I wish to bring to light.

\section{Methodology}
The published research annotated are the top-10 articles selected from the commercial research databases available from the State Library of New South Wales. This list was arrived at in the following stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preparation:
    by operationalizing the inquiry \textit{"Refereed articles on block-chain token-economics using rational expectations equilibrium (a.k.a. no-arbitrage) arguments/analysis, ranked by journal impact factors"};
    \item Retrieval:
    eliminating duplicates;
    \item Screening:
    removing false positives;
    ranking by journal impact factor;
    \item Selection:
    selecting the top-10; and
    \item Write-up:
    reviewing remaining article abstracts and substituting where judged appropriate.
\end{enumerate}

Operationalized on ProQuest:
