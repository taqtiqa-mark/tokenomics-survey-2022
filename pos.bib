  abstract     = {Permissionless blockchains require a protocol to generate consensus. Many prominent permissionless blockchains employ Proof-of-Work (PoW) for that purpose, but PoW possesses significant shortcomings. Various alternatives have been proposed. This paper provides the first formal economic model of the most famous alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and establishes conditions under which PoS generates consensus. A sufficiently modest reward schedule not only implies the existence of an equilibrium in which consensus obtains as soon as possible but also precludes a persistent forking equilibrium. The latter result arises because PoS, unlike PoW, requires that validators are also stakeholders.},

This paper studies
consensus within the context of a particularly important class of blockchain
known as a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain.

The members of this network not only store but also update the ledger and are referred to as validators. The ledger's usefulness depends on validators agreeing on its contents: Consensus

blockchain's potential to improve financial market efficiency hinges on
the viability of permissionless (i.e., unrestricted) blockchains

economic protocol (PoW)

this paper
theoretically studies PoS blockchains, blockchains that employ PoS as the
economic protocol. PoS replaces PoW's competition by offering a randomly
selected stakeholder the authority to update the blockchain. As such, PoS omits
any incentive for validators to engage in a computational arms race.


PoS, like PoW, offers a validator an explicit
monetary reward, referred to as a block reward, to update the blockchain, but
PoS, unlike PoW, does not require validators to incur an explicit monetary
cost (such as that incurred from solving PoW's puzzle) to gain the authority
to update the blockchain

lack of an explicit cost
coupled with the explicit benefit of the block reward implies that a validator
will always update the ledger whenever given the opportunity even if the update
necessarily perpetuates disagreement. This assertion is known as the Nothing-
at-Stake problem, and it nullifies the viability of PoS if true because it implies
that an initial disagreement persists indefinitely.


first contribution is to establish that the Nothing-at-Stake
problem is not valid in general.

The Nothing-at-Stake
problem implicitly makes a price-taking assumption so that a validator does
not internalize the effect of her decisions on the value of the blockchain's
native coin. This assumption is not appropriate for a validator in a PoS setting.
If a validator appends to the blockchain in a way that perpetuates disagreement,
then she imposes a cost on all stakeholders because her action undercuts the
ability of users to exchange the native coin and thereby lowers its value. PoS
grants authority to update the blockchain to only stakeholders; thus, within
PoS, a validator imposes a cost on herself if she updates the blockchain in a
manner that persists disagreement.

provides conditions under which PoS generates consensus.

Formally, I show that restricting access to update
the blockchain to sufficiently large stakeholders induces an equilibrium that
generates consensus expediently. This result arises because the cost of updating
the blockchain in a manner that persists disagreement increases with a
validator's stake. That cost increases in a validator's stake because, as previously
referenced, persisting disagreement reduces coin value and stake references the
number of coins that one holds. For a sufficiently large stakeholder, the cost of
persisting disagreement outweighs the benefit from the block reward and thus
a sufficiently high minimum stake requirement to update the ledger generates
an equilibrium in which validators coordinate on generating consensus.

Corollary 1, a zero block reward
generates consensus without a restriction on the set of stakeholders that may
update the blockchain. This result arises because the zero block reward removes
the only potential gain from propagating disagreement.

Thus, with nothing to gain
from updating multiple branches (zero block reward) and a cost incurred from
updating no branches, a zero block reward induces an equilibrium in which all
stakeholders coordinate to update a single branch of the blockchain.

Proposition 4, demonstrates that
a sufficiently modest block reward schedule implies that disagreement resolves
eventually with probability one within any equilibrium. This result arises
because stakeholder incentives involve two components: initial coin holdings
and block rewards. When the latter component, block rewards, is sufficientlyBlockchain without Waste: Proof-of-Stake

small, then the former component, initial coin holdings, becomes the dominant
incentive. Since disagreement undermines the blockchain's native coin value, a
sufficiently modest block reward schedule drives each stakeholder to prioritize
generating consensus regardless of the strategies of other stakeholders. In turn,
this behavior generates consensus eventually in any equilibrium.

The ability to generate consensus with low block rewards distinguishes
PoS from PoW. The reason for this difference arises because PoS requires
all validators to hold native coins. That requirement ensures that low block
rewards shift validator incentives toward maximizing the value of native coins,
which, in turn, encourages validators to seek consensus. Within PoW, validators
need not hold any native coins so that reducing block rewards does not align
incentives toward maximizing the value of native coins; rather, reducing block
rewards undermines the incentive for validators to participate in the validation
process at all.

demonstrates benefits for PoS protocols imposing a validator
minimum stake requirement and employing modest block reward schedules.

A minimum stake requirement requires that the PoS protocol restrict access
to update the ledger to sufficiently large stakeholders. A modest block reward
schedule requires that block rewards offered to validators for updating the ledger
be kept small. Both the discussed measures help generate consensus within a
PoS protocol as demonstrated by Proposition 2, Corollary 1, and Proposition 4

This paper differs from those works
that rely on exogenous behavioral assumptions by employing the standard
economic paradigm of implying agent behavior based on preferences, payoffs,
and equilibrium analysis.

this paper does not seek to match any single implementation. Rather, this paper studies a chain-based PoS protocol that captures the most economically
relevant aspects of an arbitrary PoS protocol.

The simplest implementation of PoS, known as the
Follow-the-Satoshi (FTS) algorithm, involves each blockchain branch selecting
uniformly and randomly from the universe of native coins.5 The owner of the
selected coin receives the opportunity to append to the branch that selected
her coin and simultaneously collect a block reward. This protocol succeeds
in reducing energy expenditure to negligible levels, but in doing so, PoS
faces an objection known as the Nothing-at-Stake problem

The Nothing-at-Stake problem assumes an initial
disagreement and argues that this disagreement will persist indefinitely for a
PoS protocol.

The argument also asserts that the player faces no cost
from appending to the ledger, implicitly invoking a price-taking assumption.

this argument asserts that appending a block is a weakly dominant strategy and since some player receives the opportunity to append to each
branch during each time slot, the argument concludes that any existing branch
will receive a new block in every time slot so that any initial fork will persist
indefinitely.

This paper highlights that the Nothing-at-Stake problem's price-taking
assumption is not appropriate for the setting.

equilibrium behavior under a PoS protocol is not as suggested by the Nothing-
at-Stake problem, and this paper offers a set of conditions under which PoS
generates consensus in the presence of an initial disagreement.

the aforementioned requires a premise that the value of a blockchain's
native coin depends on the ability to exchange the native coin

some PoS implementations (e.g., Ethereum's Casper)
combat the Nothing-at-Stake problem with explicit punishment schemes.
but Brown-Cohen et al. (2019) establish that detection of the Noting-
at-Stake problem requires making PoS vulnerable to the Double-Spending
Attack.7 Consequently, developing a PoS incentive structure that overcomes
the Nothing-at-Stake problem without explicit punishment is important

this paper does precisely that by providing restrictions on PoS protocol design
parameters that overcome the Nothing-at-Stake problem.

model an extensive form game
Two salient strategies: 
- the Longest Chain Rule strategy: appending only to the longest branch whenever feasible with the longest chain being defined as branch 1 whenever both branches possess the same length
- the Nothing-at-Stake strategy: appending a block whenever given the opportunity

Proposition 2 establishes the existence of an equilibrium in which PoS obtains
consensus. Proposition 4 provides conditions under which all equilibria achieve
consensus eventually with probability one.

Proposition 2, I demonstrate that this cost can be made sufficiently
large to induce a symmetric equilibrium in which all players follow LCR.

Proposition 2. Immediate Consensus
R
If $min \pi i \times S \geq \delta k (1 - \delta )$
2 , then there exists an equilibrium in which each player
follows the longest chain rule. In such an equilibrium, the fork resolves at
$t = k$.

Corollary 1. No Block Reward
If $\all t \in N : R_t = 0$, then there exists an equilibrium in which each player follows
the longest chain rule.

A myopic player with no coins always
appends to the blockchain when given the option if the block reward takes a
strictly positive value.
