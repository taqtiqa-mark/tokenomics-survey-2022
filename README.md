comment = {Derive an equilibrium token pricing formula that incorporates endogenous network effects in an otherwise canonical Gordon growth formula.

The authors are not concerned with the implications of blockchain technology on currencies and monetary policies in general. Rather, their focus is the interaction between token pricing and user adoption for platforms that serve niche markets with time-varying (stochastic) productivity. A particular emphasis is on user heterogeneity and its asset pricing implications.

Two key endogenous variables likely to be of interest to token economy designers are: market price of tokens and the platform user base.  These are detailed and analyzed extensively, and will repay close study.

central is agent i’s option to leave the platform and avoid losses from by holding the platform token. This is somewhat analogous to the option equity holders have to exit a firm. However, for equity holders the legal nature of the firm limits their liability.  In the event that the platform is not equivalent to a limited liability entity, platform participants will not have this put option. The authors are silent on whom the platform holders put these losses - they do not vanish into thin air. For traditional securities, equity holders only have this option to avoid losses by putting the firm into the hands of debt holders - who sold this option to equity holders in return for a premium.  Otherwise platform holders can not simply chose to avoid losses, they have to carry them until the platform ceases to operate.
we consider the following widely used specification of SDF, which we denote
by $\Lambda$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Lambda_{t}}{\Lambda_{t}}\!=\!-\!\,r d t\!-\!\,\eta d\widehat{Z}_{t}^{\Lambda},
\end{equation}
where r is the risk-free rate and η is the price of risk for systematic shock under the physical measure.

Let ρ denote the instantaneous correlation between the SDF shock and the platform productivity shock At . A positive ρ implies a positive beta.
Having a productivity beta (systematic risk) that increases with adoption is broadly consistent with observed "bubbly" price dynamics.

the adoption problem in platform economics is a prominent one (e.g., Rochet and Tirole 2006) and is naturally connected with the carry cost in the classical models of money as a transaction medium (e.g., Baumol 1952; Tobin 1956)

The treatment of convenience yield is related to Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and earlier studies. 

The contribution is to incorporate user network effects in the convenience yield mechanism is related to, but different from, that in Harrison and Kreps (1978) and Scheinkman and Xiong (2003), as the expected capital gain in the authors model is due to the growth of user base rather than heterogeneous beliefs.

The flow of user utility from using the platform is specified to be a function of:
- platform productivity (exogenous)
- user type
- user adoption
- the numeraire value of the user token holdings ("real token balance")

The tokenless model is analogous to the standard money models of holdings (e.g., Ljungqvist and Sargent 2004). The novel modeling ingredient is the user network effect — the positive externality of user adoption decisions — which is a defining feature of digital platforms.

Transaction utility in the tokenized economy depends on the numeraire value of goods and services transacted, per standard monetary models.}
