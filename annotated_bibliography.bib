  abstract     = {Blockchain technology provides decentralized consensus and potentially enlarges the contracting space through smart contracts. Meanwhile, generating decentralized consensus entails distributing information that necessarily alters the informational environment. We analyze how decentralization relates to consensus quality and how the quintessential features of blockchain remold the landscape of competition. Smart contracts can mitigate informational asymmetry and improve welfare and consumer surplus through enhanced entry and competition, yet distributing information during consensus generation may encourage greater collusion. In general, blockchains sustain market equilibria with a wider range of economic outcomes. We further discuss the implications for antitrust policies targeted at blockchain applications.},

We further assume that $X\_{0}$ is sufficiently low so that the growth options of all firms in the industry are strictly positive at $t=0$. Throughout the paper, we denote by $\mu \_{\mathbf{y}t}$ and $\sigma \_{\mathbf{y}t}$ the mean and standard deviation of any variable $y$ at time $t$, and we omit the subscript $t$ when $\mu \_{\mathbf{y}}$ or $\sigma \_{\mathbf{y}}$ are constant over time.},

  abstract     = {We develop a dynamic asset pricing model of cryptocurrencies/tokens that allow users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions on digital platforms. The equilibrium price of tokens is determined by aggregating heterogeneous users' transactional demand, rather than discounting cash flows as is done in standard valuations models. Endogenous platform adoption builds on user network externality and exhibits an $S$-curve: it starts slow, becomes volatile, and eventually tapers off. The introduction of tokens lowers users' transaction costs on the platform by allowing users to capitalize on platform growth. The resultant intertemporal feedback between user adoption and token price accelerates adoption and dampens user-base volatility.},

  abstract     = {We develop a dynamic model of a platform economy where tokens serve as a means of payment among platform users and are issued to finance investment in platform productivity. Tokens are optimally rewarded to platform owners when token supply (normalized by productivity) is low and burnt to boost franchise value when the normalized supply is high. Although token price is determined in a liquid market, the platform's financial constraint generates an endogenous token issuance cost that causes underinvestment through the conflict of interest between insiders (owners) and outsiders (users). Blockchain technology mitigates underinvestment by addressing the owners' time inconsistency problem.},

There is a long history of trading stamps and loyalty points, but new technologies are poised to sharply raise the significance of redeemable assets as a store of value. Here, we develop a simple stylized model of redeemable tokens that can be used to study sales and pricing strategies for issuing tokens, including ICOs. Our central finding is that platforms can potentially earn higher revenues by making tokens non-tradable unless they can generate a sufficiently high outside-platform convenience yield.},
