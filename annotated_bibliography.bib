        The authors provide a succinct introduction to blockchain economics. They distinguish a blockchain from crypto-tokens and currencies. Introduce the key concepts and features of blockchains. Highlight its decentralized nature, cryptographic security, and immutability. The authors also explore the possible impact of a blockchain on different sectors.  They focus on technical improvements and applications. And adopt an economic perspective to identify useful and desirable features of blockchains.
        
        Section 2 defines the general concept of a blockchain. The authors consider decentralized consensus to be its main advantage over traditional systems. They explore the skeptical view that a  blockchain is only a database upgrade. In their view, blockchains provide a trust system using the following building blocks. 1) Prevent a single point of failure. 2) Reduce market power and enable stakeholding. And 3) enable value exchange, asset traceability, and information interaction. Further, zero-knowledge-proof on top of blockchains enable multi-party computation applications.

        Section 3 considers games under consensus protocols. Decentralization, scalability, and consensus are identified as desirable features of a blockchain. Also identified, is a tension between them - the blockchain impossibility triangle. Protocols canvased are Proof-of-work, Byzantine fault tolerance, Proof-of-stake, and Proof-of-burn. In each use case, the authors suggest finding the need for decentralization, scalability, and consensus. Then design the protocols and business models as required.

        Section 4 considers network security, excess concentration, energy use, adoption, and smart contracts. There is an emphasis on information sharing and gathering in decentralized systems. As well as how permissioned blockchains enable better multi-party computation and information exchange.
        
        Section 5 summarizes promising future directions for industry development.

    abstract     = {We develop a dynamic asset pricing model of cryptocurrencies/tokens that allow users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions on digital platforms. The equilibrium price of tokens is determined by aggregating heterogeneous users' transactional demand, rather than discounting cash flows as is done in standard valuations models. Endogenous platform adoption builds on user network externality and exhibits an S-curve: it starts slow, becomes volatile, and eventually tapers off. The introduction of tokens lowers users' transaction costs on the platform by allowing users to capitalize on platform growth. The resultant intertemporal feedback between user adoption and token price accelerates adoption and dampens user-base volatility.},

        Consider a specific blockchain, with a wide range of users, where each user has diverse needs for value transfers and smart contracts. In that setting, the authors calculate a formula for the effervescent-token price,

        \begin{align}

          P\left(A_{t}\right) &= \frac{N\left(A_{t}\right)S\left(A_{t}\right)A_{t}}{M}\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{r-\mu_t^{P}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}, \\

          N_{t} &= 1-G_{t}\left(\underline{{u}}_{t}\right),

        \end{align}

        where $M$ is the token supply, $S\left(A_{t}\right)$ measures the aggregate transaction needs, and could be approximated by daily transaction volume, $\mu_{t}^{P}$ is the endogenously determined intantaneous drift of the price diffusion, $r$ is the required rate of return on user token holdings, and $\alpha$ is a constant parameter related to the flow of utility (or convenience yield) generated by user token holdings (over $dt$). $N\left(A_{t}\right)$ is the platform user base, and could be approximated by daily active addresses. Decreasing marginal utility is captured by a constant $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Finally, $A_{t}$ evolves according to a geometric Brownian motion stochastic differential equation with constant instantaneous drift, $\mu^{A}$, and instantaneous diffusion, $\sigma^{A}$, $G_t(\dots)$ is a cumulative probability function, and $\underbar{u}_t$ is the marginal user platform adoption threshold,

        \begin{equation}

        \underbar{{u}}_{t} = -\ln(N_{t})+\ln\left({\frac{\phi}{A_{t}\alpha}}\right)-\left({\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\right)\ln\left({\frac{1-\alpha}{r-\mu_{t}^{P}}}\right),
               
        \end{equation} 
               
        where $\phi$ is a cost of joining the platform.
               
        When platform productivity, $A_{t}$, is sufficiently high, all agents participate with probability one at all times, $s \geq t$, such that

        \begin{equation}

        \overline{P}\left(A_{t}\right) = \frac{\overline{S}A_{t}}{M}\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{r-\mu^{A}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}

        \end{equation}

        where $\overline{S}$ is the aggregate transaction needs of all agents.
               
        This model shows that token prices can elevate, crash then stabilize. The authors describe this as "bubbly". But, the term "bubble", in financial economics, has a meaning different from that here. Hence, I use the term "effervescent". This forecloses the conclusion that such prices reflect a deviation from the fundamentals. The authors show that when endogenous adoption drives the correlation between the stochastic discount factor and token return, then, these "effervescent" price dynamics can arise in a rational expectations model.
               
        The authors build a dynamic feedback loop between user adoption and token prices. Here token prices reflect expectations about the future growth of platform use. They use a framework that highlights user heterogeneity.  Then study the simultaneous calculation of user adoption and token valuation. In this setting, tokens are valuable because they allow users to make transactions on the digital platform. This makes the token a hybrid of money and investable assets.

        Users make a two-step decision. First, decide whether to become a platform user by paying a participation cost. And, if so, decide the real token balance. The token market clears by equating user demand and fixed supply. Owning tokens incurs a carrying cost, the return lost by not investing in other financial assets. This cost is partly offset by the expected token price appreciation.

        Some assumed and derived properties of the platform are 1) fixed token supply. 2) Monetary neutrality ensures that the token market is always stable. 3) There are network effects for the platform from user adoption. 4) Users are heterogeneous. 5) User utility from platform activities makes up only a small part of their total utility. And 6) a token payment is for specific economic transactions (i.e. the token is not a medium for generic payments).

        The model contains financial and real sectors. The financial sector operates through the endogenous determination of token prices. The real sector manifests itself in user adoption.  A tokenless model is analogous to the standard money models of holdings.

        The model is solved via the change-of-measure technique (see \fullcite{duffie01b}).

        The user network effect and intertemporal feedback results apply to platforms owned by trusted third parties, permissioned blockchains, and permissionless blockchains. Key platform properties that flow from the assumptions and analysis are as follows. Token value depends on platform productivity. User adoption follows a log-Normal S-curve. And platform adoption dynamics influence token asset pricing dynamics. Given a tokenless platform with the same productivity as a tokenized platform, but uses a numeraire good for payments. Then the user base of the tokenized platform is larger, and more stable, than the tokenless platform. 

        Various figures illustrate the model dynamics and parameters.

Tokens are optimally rewarded to platform owners when token supply (normalized by productivity) is low and burnt to boost franchise value when the normalized supply is high.

Blockchain technology mitigates underinvestment by addressing the owners' time inconsistency problem.},

        Consider three types of users in a dynamic continuous-time economy. 1) Platform owners. 2) Contributors (miners/validators, distributed-application developers, etc.). And 3) Platform users. With a generic consumption good as the numeraire, and an optimal token supply, the equilibrium price for a dampened token is, in general,
        
        \begin{align} 
        
            P_{t} &= \frac{N_{t}^{\gamma}U_{t}A_{t}}{M_{t}}\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{r-\mu_{t}^{P}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}, \\

        \end{align} 
               
        where $A_t$ is platform productivity (synonymous with quality), $U_t$ is the transaction need aggregated over participating users, $N_t$ is the endogenously determined platform user base, $M_t$ is the total amount of circulating tokens, $\mu_{t}^{P}$ is the endogenously determined intantaneous drift of the price diffusion, $r$ is the required rate of return on user token holdings, and $\alpha$ is a constant parameter related to the flow of utility (or convenience yield) generated by user token holdings (over $dt$), $G_t(\dots)$ is a cumulative probability function, and $\underbar{u}_t$ is the marginal user platform adoption threshold,

        \begin{equation}

        \underbar{{u}}_{t} = \frac{\phi}{N_{t}^{\gamma}A_{t}\alpha}\left(\frac{r-\mu_{t}^{p}}{1-\alpha}\right)^{\frac{1+\alpha}{\alpha}},
               
        \end{equation} 

        where $\phi$ is a cost of joining the platform, $ \gamma \in (0, 1)$ relates to the network effect of user adoption (when there is no network effect $\gamma = 0$).
               
        When parameterized explicit expressions can be obtained for $N_t$, $U_t$ and $P_t$, regardless of the consensus protocol and level of decentralization.

        Compared to the authors' other work, annotated herein, in this paper, both $A_t$ and the token supply $M_t$ are endogenous. In fact, stabilized token prices result from the dynamic, optimal payout and buyback decisions of the platform owners.  To illustrate the size of this effect, a 200\% per annum volatility of productivity yields token price volatility below 0.15\% per annum.
               
        A platform is a currency area (economy) where a unique set of economic activities take place.  Its tokens derive value by facilitating associated transactions. Stylized features of the economy are: 
               
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Tokens are monetary assets.
            \item Current platform productivity and normalized token supply are the key state variables.
            \item Platform transactions are in native tokens. 
            \item The marginal value of extra platform productivity is positive.
            \item The marginal value of the extra token supply is negative.
        \end{enumerate}
               
        The authors analyze the optimal token supply. Explore the dynamics of platform investment and financing. And the conflict of interest between the entrepreneur and users. They show a blockchain can allow a commitment not to expropriate value through excessive seignorage.
               
        The authors offer a corporate finance perspective of protocol design. It connects work on platform economics to work on the role of financial slack and issuance costs in setting capital structure. Platform token supply management involves investment, payout, and buyback decisions. And they analyze such platform token supply management, instead of cash management. When investment induces user network effects, the token price varies as users respond to supply variations. This perspective applies to both traditional and blockchain-based platforms. 

        Token issuances or buy-backs finance the platform owner's investment in productivity.  In return for tokens, contributors commit effort and resources to improve platform productivity. Users desire tokens to pay on the platform (convenience yield) and they buy tokens from contributors. User holdings expose them to the fluctuation of token price. This leads to an intertemporal complementarity that amplifies the effects of platform productivity changes on user adoption. The amount of resources the platform can raise by issuing tokens depends on the token price. User token demand and platform owner token supply set the token price.  Furthermore, the optimal token supply strategy stabilizes the token price.
               
        Several insights result from the model. 1) Tokens are akin to durable goods but defy Coase's conjecture (see \fullcite{coase72}). 2) Under investment arises from the conflict of interest between the entrepreneur and platform users. That is, an entrepreneurial time inconsistency problem arises. This is when the optimal ex-ante level of investment is suboptimal ex-post. 3) Blockchain enables commitment to predetermined rules of investment. This can add value by addressing the entrepreneurial time inconsistency problem. 4) Platforms with endogenous productivity growth have stable tokens.

    abstract     = {We examine decentralization of digital platforms through tokenization as an innovation to resolve the conflict between platforms and users. By delegating control to users, tokenization through utility tokens acts as a commitment device that prevents a platform from exploiting users. This commitment comes at the cost of not having an owner with an equity stake who, in conventional platforms, would subsidize participation to maximize the platform's network effect. This trade-off makes utility tokens a more appealing funding scheme than equity for platforms with weak fundamentals. The conflict reappears when nonusers, such as token investors and validators, participate on the platform.},
    annote       = {
        Consider an online platform that facilitates bilateral transactions among a pool of users. A utility token entitles holders to services but not the cash flows of the platform.  To take part on the platform requires only one token. Hence, because they only enable transactions, there is no incentive to hoard tokens. From this, the authors show, the introduction of non-users produces conflicts that are difficult to resolve. Introduce one of two non-user groups: equity holders or miners/validators.  Now, with miners/validators or equity holders, the platform can break down. This means there are no users particpating in the platform. The authors explore the conditions under which such breakable-tokens deteriorate.
               
        The model is a rational expectations cutoff equilibrium in which the utility token price is

        \begin{equation} 
        
            P = \exp{\left((1-\eta_{c})\tau_{\varepsilon}^{-1/2}z^{T}+A+\frac{1}{2}\eta_{c}^{2}\tau_{\varepsilon}^{-1}\right)}\Phi\bigl(\eta_{c}\tau_{\varepsilon}^{-1/2}-z^{T}\bigr)-\kappa, 
        
        \end{equation}

        and
               
        \begin{equation}

               z^{T}={\sqrt{\tau_{\varepsilon}}}({\hat{A}}^{T}-A)

        \end{equation}
               
        where $\tau_{\varepsilon}$ is the dispertion term in a random walk model of user endovments, $\eta_{c} \in (0, 1)$ represents the weight in a Cobb-Douglas utility function on his consumption of his trading partner's good $C_j$, and $1 -\eta_{c}$ is the weight on the consumption of his own good $C_i$. A higher $\eta_{c}$ means a stronger complementarity between the consumption of the two goods. $A$ is the aggregate goods endowment across all users, and could be approximated by total transaction fees. And ${\hat{A}}^{T}$ is the threshold value in the users cutoff strategy for utility token purchases.

        When the platform has validators or miners present, strategic attacks have a known probability of success. The authors provide an expression for this probability.
        
        The authors also consider a conventional equity-based funding scheme. In this scheme, equity conveys both control and cash flow rights. They compare this equity scheme to several utility token schemes.
               
        Without investors, there are users only, and the hybrid equity-utility token price $P$ is

        \begin{equation} 
        
            P = \exp{\left(A+\frac12\left((1-\eta_{c})^{2}+\eta_{c}^{2}\right)\tau_{\varepsilon}^{-1}\right)} -\kappa, 
        
        \end{equation}

        where $\kappa$ is a user partition cost.

        With investors and users the hybrid equity-utility token price $P$ is

        \begin{equation} 
        
            P = \frac{{\frac{1}{2}}\delta_{T}U+(1-s_{I})\frac{1}{2}\delta_{T}U+s_{I}\gamma\,\Phi\bigl(-z_{I}^{E T}\bigr)}{n+N+\Phi\bigl(-z_{I}^{E T}\bigr)}-s_{I}\gamma+p_{I}^{E T}, 
        
        \end{equation}
        
        and
               
        \begin{equation}

               z_{I}^{ET}={\sqrt{\tau_{\varepsilon}}}({\hat{A}_I}^{ET}-A)

        \end{equation}
               
        where ${\hat{A}_I}^{ET}$ is the cutoff endowment of the marginal investor, $p_I^{ET}$ is a price discount/premium for the marginal user, $\delta_{T}$ is the developer profit maximizing transaction fee, $U$ is a Cobb-Douglas utility function where users are risk-neutral with respect to the uncertainty of their wealth, $N$ is number of tokens in the developer's retention policy, $\gamma$ is harm to users from the owners subverting actions, and $s_I \in {0, 1}$ is the subverting action at $t = 2$. For example, investors modify the platform and sell user data to third parties, $s_I = 1$. The investor decision to subvert the platform is expressed via an inequality relation, which the authors derive.
               
        The aggregate endowment $A$ is a key characteristic of the platform. A well designed platform attracts users with strong needs to transact with each other. That is, users need to trade goods with each other, which can occur only on the platform. Together, these produce a network effect. 
               
        In this telling, there are three dates. At time $0$, the platform developer funds the platform. Based on a prior belief about the platform's fundamentals, they issue traditional equity or tokens. The choice of funding scheme also determines the control and ownership of the platform in the later periods. At a time of $t = 1$, potential users choose whether to join the platform, subject to a cost. Each Platform user can match with another user to make beneficial transactions at $t = 1$ and $t = 2$. These times are the short run, $t=1$, and the long run, $t=2$. Those who do not join at time $0$ cannot take part in either round of trading. 

        Issuing equity leads to an owner who can profit by charging transaction fees. The owner can commit to not exploiting users at time $0$, and they choose to provide a subsidy at time $1$ to attract the marginal user. Control of the platform allows the owner to exploit users at time $2$ after the platform collects extensive data about them at time $1$. Under the equity scheme, the owner can always choose, at times $2$, to reverse any prior commitment. This owner-user tension is like owner-manager agency conflicts in corporate finance. Naturally, users want to find a way to bind the owner to their prior commitments. This demand for commitment motivates tokenization.

        With a hybrid equity-utility token or miners/validators, their cash flow rights can result in them taking control of the platform.  This introduces the commitment problem, as described above. Without commitment devices, concern about the exploitation of users grows. User participation, owner profit, and social surplus are all lower, and the breakdown of the platform is more likely.
               
        Here a token is an asset that conveys a right to the services of the platform, participation in its governance, but not cash flow rights. Hence, this includes the "payment" and "consumer" ("utility") tokens in the taxonomy of Global Digital Finance (GDF). Finally, the authors show that weak platforms are more likely to adopt the utility token-based scheme.

The network effect governing user participation, in conjunction with the nonneutrality of the token price, can cause the token market to break down. We show that token retradeability mitigates this risk of breakdown on younger platforms by harnessing user optimism but worsens this fragility when sentiment trading by speculators crowds out users. Elastic token issuance mitigates this fragility, but strategic attacks by miners exacerbate it because users' anticipation of future losses depresses the token's resale value.},

        The authors consider an online platform made up of users, speculators, and validators. The interactions of these three groups lead to rich price dynamics. In a discrete-time setting, with infinitely many periods, overlaping generations, and fixed token supply, the rational expectations cut-off equilibrium token price is

        \begin{align} 
        
            P_{t} &= \frac{1}{R}\exp\left(\frac{\sqrt{\tau_{\varepsilon}}}{\lambda}\left(A_{t}-A_{t}^{\ast}\right)-\frac{1}{\lambda}y_t+\frac{1}{\lambda}\zeta_{t}\right), \\

        where $R \geq 1$ is the interest rate for the holding period, and $U_t^*$ is the total transaction surplus on the platform. 

        $A_{t}$ is the aggregate endowment, and is a key characteristic of the platform, $A_{t}^{*}$ is the marginal users' participation threshold that solves a fixed-point condition, $\tau_{\varepsilon}$ is a measure of endowment dispersion among users. $\lambda > 0$ parameterizes speculator short-selling cut-off policies, $\zeta_{t}$ is speculator sentiment, and $y_t$ is token supply. 
               
        The structure of public information for all users is $\mathcal{I}_{t}=\left\{A_{t},y_{t},Q_{t},\zeta_{t}\right\}$; the demand fundamental, time-varying token supply, user optimism and speculator sentiment.
               
        Cryptocurrency returns, $R$, have three components: 1) a convenience yield of the marginal user (dividend), 2) capital gain, and 3) user participation cost compensation. Where $\beta > 0$ is the fraction of the utility surplus paid as a platform service fee, $E\left[P_{t+1}\mid \mathcal{I}_{t}\right]$ is the token price expected in the next period, and $\kappa$ is a user partition cost.

        For the aggregate transaction surplus, $\eta_{c} \in (0, 1)$ represents the weight in the Cobb-Douglas utility function on a user's consumption of her trading partner's good, and $1 -\eta_{c}$ is the weight on consumption of her own good. A higher $\eta_{c}$ indicates a stronger complementarity between the consumption of the goods obtained from trading.

        Here tokens ease transactions between platform users of certain goods or services.  That is, these tokens are not a general means of exchange. Also, the authors focus on utility token price dynamics and platform stability. Nonetheless, their results also apply to coins and altcoins. In particular, the role of coins and altcoins in 1) Funding digital platforms. 2) Serving as investment assets for speculators. And 3) decentralized consensus protocols.

        This model shows a platform is fragile whenever there is a fixed token supply, a user network effect, and a token price that is not neutral. Retradability, elastic issuance, and user optimism all mitigate this instability. Reductions in the token's expected retrade value exacerbated the instability. Speculators crowding out users reduces the token retrade value.  Users' expecting strategic miner attacks also reduce the token retrade value. Hence, while miner attacks do not lead the platform to fail, expected losses from miner attacks can increase platform fragility. This is especially true when the mining cost is high. In this model, blockchain speculation differs from other assets, such as stocks and commodities. In stocks and commodities, speculation can increase price volatility. But for blockchains, speculation can lead to price and demand both collapsing to zero.  The authors explore design choices that may make a platform more robust to breaking down.

        Token retradability is a powerful dual-edged tool for enhancing or harming platform performance. Token retradability enhances performance when it capitalizes on user optimism. Yet, this effect of user optimism declines as the platform matures. Given otherwise identical platforms. This suggests a large market value platform might be more fragile than a small market value platform.   And thus, larger platforms may have more pronounced price volatility than smaller, identical, platforms.
        
        Token retradability harms performance when it incentivizes speculator enthusiasm. Speculation acts as a tax on user participation and exacerbates the platform's instability.  Having outsiders with a conflict of interest with users increases  cryptocurrency platform instability.

        By introducing mining and strategic attacks, the miners' common mining efficiency $\xi_t$ is an extra state variable. Here, efficiency is the inverse of the miner's cost of mining. Strategic attacks occur when either $A_t$ or $\xi_t$ falls below a critical boundary.  This boundary reveals it may be possible for both a no-attack equilibrium and an attack equilibrium to be self-fulfilling. Furthermore, expecting strategic attacks leads to an adverse feedback loop.  This feedback loop is novel to decentralized cryptocurrency platforms. These insights are valid for other types of attacks. For example,  a selfish mining attack. They also apply to other consensus protocols, such as proof of stake, if the interests of validators conflict with those of users.

        Several empirical implications for cryptocurrency return patterns flow from this model, both time-series patterns (e.g., momentum, reversal, life-cycle effects, relation to investor attention, chance of strategic attacks) and cross-sectional patterns (e.g., size effect). Five (5) propositions are proved in the course of the model development.

    abstract     = {Can massive online retailers such as Amazon and Alibaba issue digital tokens that potentially compete with bank debit accounts? There is a long history of trading stamps and loyalty points, but new technologies are poised to sharply raise the significance of redeemable assets as a store of value. Here, we develop a simple stylized model of redeemable tokens that can be used to study sales and pricing strategies for issuing tokens, including ICOs. Our central finding is that platforms can potentially earn higher revenues by making tokens non-tradable unless they can generate a sufficiently high outside-platform convenience yield.},

        \end{quote}

        The authors consider a stylized partial equilibrium model of using redeemable tokens in place of using fiat currency. The purpose is to explore the design, features, sales, and pricing strategies for issuing these redeemable tokens. The issue strategies are an 'initial coin offering' (ICO), a 'seasoned coin offerings' (SCO), or a combination of an ICO and SCO.

        They start with a simple price strategy, selling all non-tradable and tradable tokens for the same price. Then they move to more sophisticated pricing strategies. Here platforms use a price menu ("buy more and save more") to sell tokens.  The most general result is a separating equilibrium for the price menu with diverse consumers. Using a price menu, the platform could exploit all the potential gains from inter-temporal trade, but only if the token is non-tradable. For tradable tokens, a price menu adds nothing to the platform's options.

        Non-tradable ICO optimal issuance: Assume the platform sets the issue quantity $M$, then the issue price is

        \begin{equation} 
               
            P_{I,N}=\left[\frac{\beta p}{1-\beta(1-p)}\right]^{M} 
               
        \end{equation}

        where $\beta$ is the users' time discount factor, $p$ is the probability the consumer demands one unit of the platform commodity. Let $R_{I,N}$ be the total revenue from a non-tradable ICO,

        \begin{equation} 
               
            R_{I,N} = \underbrace{M P_{I,N}}_{Token~Issuance} + \underbrace{\left[\frac{\beta^{\textasteriskcentered}p}{1-\beta^{\textasteriskcentered}(1-p)}\right]^{M} \frac{\beta^{\textasteriskcentered}p}{1-\beta^{\textasteriskcentered}}}_{Fiat~Money}.
               
        \end{equation}

        where $\beta^*$ is the platform time discount factor, and  $\beta^* < \beta$ reflects the assumption the platform has access to outside investment opportunities which are better than those the user has access to. The authors provide the two necessary and sufficient conditions to find the unique revenue-maximizing issuance quantity, $M$.
               
        Additional models considered are: 1) Tradable ICO, 2) Non-tradable ICO with price discrimination 3) Non-tradable ICO+SCO, 4) Tradable ICO+SCO, 5) Non-tradable ICO without price discrimination, 6) Tradable ICO with or without price discrimination, 6) Tradable/Non-tradable ICO+SCO without price discrimination.

        Finally, a platform chooses the pooling equilibrium if $\beta^{\textasteriskcentered} < \beta = 1$. Otherwise the platform chooses a separating equilibrium if the platform can gain sufficiently large profit from high-frequency consumers.
               
        The optimal issuance policy $(M_L, M_H, P_L, P_H )$ can be solved as a revenue maximization problem with incentive constraints and participation constraints.  The optimal token prices for frequent, $P_H$, and infrequent, $P_L$, consumers are

        \begin{align} 
               
        P_{H} &= M_{H}^{-1} \left( M_{L} P_{L}+\sum_{i=M_{L}+1}^{M_{H}} \left(\frac{\beta p_{H}}{1-\beta(1-p_{H})}\right)^{i} \right) ,\\ 
               
        P_{L} &= M_{L}^{-1} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{M_{L}} \left(\frac{\beta p_{L}}{1-\beta(1-p_{L})}\right)^{i}\right).
               
        \end{align}

        Appendix 2.4 details how to find the unique revenue-maximizing issuance quantities, $M_L$ and $M_H$.

        A central result is that platforms generally earn higher revenues via non-tradable tokens. That is, platforms should only create a new generic currency when off-platform use provides large, unique, benefits.  The gains from trade appear when the platform has a higher rate of return on its outside investments than small retail consumers. Consumers' share of the gains from trade tends to be higher with traded tokens. Tradable tokens limit the ability of a platform to offer price-quantity tradeoffs or memory features.

        In general, SCOs are possible, and this leads to a time-consistency problem for issuers and users. In principle, there are three issuance strategies. (1) A no information policy: All consumers receive the same price in every SCO regardless of their purchasing and spending history. (2) A history-dependent policy: The platform charges a SCO price that is a function of the consumer's entire history with the platform. (3) A Markov policy: Issuance depends only on the consumer's current account information (holdings of tokens). Policies (2) and (3) are 'un-money like' but reflect the richer possibilities that digital currencies offer.  But, the "no information" policy is most likely to be regulatory-compliant and least likely to raise privacy concerns.

        Potential future sales affect the price of an initial ICO. Knowing how helps show how a lack of credibility might affect initial issuance and price. If one uses SCOs to maintain a constant supply of tokens, then the most coins a consumer will hold is one. This result is the same whether tokens are tradable or not. And in fact, the tradable and non-tradable cases become equal.

        The main results are about tradability versus non-tradability. And how demand for token holdings is sensitive to future issuance policy.  These results appear to generalize to heterogeneous agents.
               
        Different regulatory treatment is appropriate when new assets offer functionality not currently available. Motivated by that observation, the paper presents a history of four (4) generations of redeemable platform assets. 1) Trading stamps (1930s-1980s). 2) Customer loyalty programs (1980s-current). 3) Platform cash/stored-value cards. And 4) crypto-coins/tokens.  The model used here most resembles platform cash/stored-value cards such as Amazon, Uber, and Alibaba. Nonetheless, some insights are relevant to the newer $4^{th}$ generation of redeemable assets.

        Consumer motivation arises, in general, from several sources. For example, tokens that offer a discount, pay interest, or provide a money-like convenience. A critical issue is how a consumer values a credit that pays for her $M^{th}$ unit of platform good. The consumer value depends on the exact timing of the consumer's needs for the platform good.

        Platform motivation arises, in general, from several sources. For example, tokens that introduce low-interest consumers, reduce transaction costs, strengthen consumer loyalty. For a given quantity, non-tradable tokens often sell at higher prices and yield higher profits to the platform. One possible reason is reminiscent of Coase's conjecture (see \fullcite{coase72}). The reason is that tradability forces the platform to compete with future resale market values. These future values limit the power to charge a high price upfront.

        Several topics discussed in more detail are consumer surplus, embedded memory, interest payments, runs, proportional costs, convenience yields, and platform commitments. History-dependent issuance and issuance based on current holdings is reminiscent of \fullcite{kocherlakota98}.

        Nine (9) Propositions are proved in the course of developing the models.

    abstract = {This paper examines the sets of feasible allocations in a large class of economic environments in which commitment is impossible (following Myerson [8], the standard definition of feasibility is adapted to take account of the lack of commitment). The environments feature eithermemoryormoney. Memory is defined as knowledge on the part of an agent of the full histories of all agents with whom he has had direct or indirect contact in the past. Money is defined as an object that does not enter utility or production functions, and is available in fixed supply. The main proposition is that any allocation that is feasible in an environment with money is also feasible in the same environment with memory. Depending on the environment, the converse may or may not be true. Hence, from a technological point of view, money is equivalent to a primitive form of memory.}
